                <span class="content_header">About Me</span><br/>
                I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> 
                at the University of Maryland, College Park 
                with an affiliate appointment in the <a href="http://ischool.umd.edu/">College of Information Studies</a>. 
                I am also a member of the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/">Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL),</a> 
                the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/">Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)</a>, and
                the founder of the new HCIL Hackerspace and HCIL lablet: the Makeability Lab. Research in the Makeability Lab  is funded, in part,
		by a Google Faculty Research Award, a 3M Faculty Award, and by Nokia and the NSF.
                <p></p>
                I received my Phd in Computer Science from the University of Washington in December 2011 where I was a 
                <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/global/northam/northam-fellows.aspx">
                Microsoft Research Graduate Fellow</a> and the 2010 College of Engineering "Graduate Innovator of the Year." 
                My PhD dissertation entitled <a href="publications.html#Thesis">"Sensing and Feedback of Everyday Activities to Promote Environmental Behaviors"</a>
                won numerous awards including the 2012 University of Washington Distinguished Dissertation Award and an 
                honorable mention for the national 2012 Council of Graduate Schools Distinguished Dissertation Award in Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering. 
                At UW, I was co-advised by <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/landay/">James Landay</a> and <a href="http://abstract.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/">Shwetak Patel</a>.
                I also have an MS in Information and Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine where I was advised by <a href="http://www.dourish.com/">Paul Dourish</a>. 
                During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to intern at a 
number of great research labs including <a 
href="http://www.tid.es/en/Research">Telefonica Research</a> in Barcelona, 
                <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/default.aspx">Microsoft Research</a> in Redmond, 
                and <a href="http://techresearch.intel.com/newsdetail.aspx?Id=27">Intel Research</a> in Seattle.
                <p></p>
                My work has been published in over 30 scientific peer-reviewed publications in many top venues including ACM CHI, UbiComp, IJCAI, MobiSys, ASSETS, and ICSE
                garnering three best paper awards (CHI'10, CHI'13, ASSETS'13)  and three best paper nominations (UbiComp'09, CHI'12, CHI'13). Please see my <a

                <span class="content_header">Research Focus</span><br/>
                My research focuses on designing, building, and evaluating interactive technology that addresses high 
                value social issues such as environmental sustainability, computer accessibility, and personalized 
                health and wellness. This work often involves the entire spectrum of information flow: from sensing 
                physical events, to intelligently interpreting/classifying this data, to building visualizations that 
                inform and motivate behavior. Please see my list of publications <a href="publications.html">here</a>.
                <p></p>
                My research interests can broadly be broken down into four areas:
                <p></p>
                <span class="content_subheader">Sensing and Feedback Systems for Environmental Behaviors</span><br/>
                There is often a profound disconnect between our everyday behaviors and the effects those behaviors 
                have on our health and the environment around us. In this research, I explore how technology can be 
                used to effectively sense and report information about environmental behaviors to promote awareness 
                and enable positive behavior change. Research questions involved here include: What behaviors
                should we sense and how? How, where, and when should this sensed activity data be presented? And, finally,
                What impact can sensing and feedback have on behavior?
                <p></p>
                <span class="content_subheader">Smart Cities and Sustainable Transport</span><br />
                City-wide urban infrastructures are increasingly reliant on network technology to improve and expand 
                their services. As a consequence, our interactions in the physical world are increasingly leaving 
                behind digital  footprints. In this research, I explore how these digital footprints can reveal otherwise 
                latent patterns of human behavior as well as implications for the improvement of city infrastructures 
                themselves (e.g., shared bicycling programs, rail and bus systems).
                <p></p>
                <span class="content_subheader">Health and Wellness</span><br />
                As sensors continue to decrease in size/price and advances in machine learning enable better and more 
                granular activity recognition, there is an enormous opportunity for sensing and feedback applications 
                for personal health particularly around sleeping, diet, and exercise. In the long term, I hope to 
                continue building and studying applications that motivate positive behaviors for both health and the 
                environment. Significant questions remain: What are the most effective strategies for motivating behaviors? 
                Can systems adapt their strategies to fit the individual user? How can we use technology to sustain behaviors 
                over time? What is the role of augmented reality and other forms of emerging media?
                <p></p>
				<span class="content_subheader">Computer and World Accessibility</span><br />
                As we increasingly rely on computers and mobile devices to support everyday tasks such as bill paying,
				internet browsing, and social communication, both new opportunities and new challenges emerge for those with 
				physical and/or cognitive disabilities. My interest in computer accessibility goes beyond simply investigating
				how computers can be universally usable (e.g., touchscreen accessibility) but also in how computers can be used to 
				make the world more accessible as well (e.g., studying sidewalk accessibility).
                <p></p>
                <span class="content_header">Research Approach</span><br/>
                Although my methods extend largely from Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction, my research is additionally 
                informed by perspectives in design, information visualization, economics, and behavioral and environmental 
                psychology. I also apply knowledge from data-intensive areas such as machine 
                learning and signal processing to help build and evaluate my sensing systems. My research process is 
                iterative, often beginning with lightweight formative studies and, crucially, concluding with field 
                deployments of working technology. In this way, I am interested not only in building new technologies 
                but in studying their actual effectiveness in the field. Finally, as my work is often interdisciplinary, 
                I frequently collaborate with researchers both within various sub-disciplines of computer science 
                (e.g., machine learning) as well as outside of computer science (e.g., electrical engineering and psychology).
